# STA-141B-Project
# Growing up as a kid, I always used to play cricket. Cricket has always been my favorite sport. Therefore, I chose to play around with the Indian Premier League Data Set for this project.
# The IPL is a tournament in which the major cities of India compete in a Twenty20 cricket game.
